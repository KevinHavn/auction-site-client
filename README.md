# Noroff Auction House


This is the Noroff Auction House, where users can set up listings, and bid on other listings.


## Description

This is the semester project 2, in which we were tasked with setting up an auction house. Going into this, I immediately decided that my javascript skills are my weak point - and I had to put most of my work there.
That explains why this project visually is far from the most stunning website - but it does for the most part function.

The website currently contains:

- Fully functional log in and out functionality.
- The ability for the user to edit their avatar
- The ability to post listings

Unfortunately, due to me struggling for ages with the avatar editing functions, there is no way to bid on other listings, or view them in detail.
